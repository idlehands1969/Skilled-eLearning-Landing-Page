## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I continue to learn to use flexbox and am getting better at finding it intuitive.
The big hurdle for me this time was positioning the hero image and hiding the overflow. I think I did okay, but would like to know if there was a better way than what I did.

### Continued development

I want to continue to work on flexbox and relative positioning.
